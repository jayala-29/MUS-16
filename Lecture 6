Recap
the Beatles stopped performing in August 1966
6 months earlier, Rubber Soul was released -- away from traditional rock n roll
although recorded Revolver before last tour, there was no intention to play live

Modernism
philosophical movement that moves across multiple disciplines that dominated art/music in 20th century
rooted in Marxist ideas of production and liberation
opposed to classicism, assumes progression from previous iterations of art
include emphasis on method and form, a regression towards primitivism (or simplicity)
pop ___ (mass production) are considered oppressive elements and don't figure into any serious discussion of the arts
truths are embedded within the art are universal

Postmodernism
even broader set of philosophies and practices that act as a reaction to modernism
dealing largely with personal interpretation of symbols rather than inherent meaning
most have their roots related to Capitalism and there is no devision between low and high art
emphasis on the use of tropes and found objects
irony becomes a major artistic technique
meaning is based on how the viewer perceives that content
not universal, depends on the ability of the viewer to deconstruct it

Rock and Roll as an Art Music
necessary initial component of art is that somebody calls it art
rock n roll records that were not meant for teen consumption and that were being viewed by their creators as art
although a dominant view is that Britain's art school system affected the rise of rock as art, 3/4 albums as foundational are American
not all artists agreed with their supporters
no such thing as low or high art from even music critics

Art Rock on Record
unlikely success of Rubber Soul led to an interest on the part of record companies to release rock records motivated by artistic concerns
art rock is traced to one of four albums: Pet Sounds, Freak Out, The Velvet Underground with Nico, and Revolver

The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds
Brian Wilson wanted to out-do Rubber Soul and bring rock n roll to the art world
Wilson recorded most of the album himself, the band did not like what they heard
was not a hit but is regarded as one of the greatest rock albums of all time
Wilson experimented with LSD during the recording
(Pet Sounds)

The Mothers of Intervention - Freak Out
first rock n roll double album, June 1966
relied on a high level of musicianship within the band
tricked a record company executive into thinking they were a white blues band
Tom Wilson supported Zappa's ideas freely
not a commercial success, but found a following in the counterculture movement in London
Paul said he hoped that Sgt Pepper would be The Beatles' "Freak Out"
(Trouble Every Day)

The Velvet Underground with Nico - (self-titled)
later than the other three, not released until 1967 although recorded in 1966
put together by Andy Warhol
haphazard and raw
complete financial disaster and received almost no reviews
receptive audience in London's counterculture
"every single person that bought a copy went out and started their own band" Brian Eno
(Waiting for the Man)

The Beatles - Revolver
George Martin hired 19 year old Geoff Emmerick as first engineer for the recording
Emmerick's know how and make do further allowed them to innovate in the studio
Eleanor Rigby/Yellow Submarine was the only single
Capitol was still allowed to alter the track listing and split the album in two
after this, the Beatles made Capitol sign an agreement to only release the British releases
American reviews were largely lukewarm from traditional pop/entertainment reviewers
still reached number one in every major pop market
now regarded as one of the best rock albums ever made
one of the first stereo records, different music on each speaker (left/right)
George contributed three songs to the album
part of the production was meant to reproduce the sound of being high on LSD
(Taxman)
response to inquiries by the Exchequer into their finances
opening song on the album
song is about corruption
Paul plays the guitar solo
only Beatles song that mentions an actual person: the prime minister
(Eleanor Rigby)
song is about an old lady dying
Paul and George Martin were fans of Francois Truffaut films and their soundtracks and opted have strings as the only accompaniment
completely changed the character of the song in the studio
(Love You To)
based on Buddhist ideas of the impermanence of the material
modal and clearly Indian influenced
recorded outwardly, first with George, then with Paul, then Anil Baghwat on tabla
John does not appear on the song and Ringo only plays a bit of the tambourine
(Yellow Submarine)
Ringo had begun to cast off references to early rock n roll and R&B and began to create new drum beats (subtle)
Paul claimed everything Ringo wrote sounded straight off the radio
the band conceived Yellow Submarine as a throwback to British TV comedies of the 50s, chaos and lunacy within an innocent atmosphere
the band invited all of their friends to the studio for a party and to record background vocals (likely the first crew recording)
the studio was left in the hands of 19 year old Geoff Emmerich
(Tomorrow Never Knows)
John Lennon song influenced by his reading of Timothy Learly
production reflects both George's interest in Hindustani music and Paul's interest in the musical Avant Garde
considered a masterpiece of rock production and the ability of The Beatles to remain focused while working in the psychedelic aesthetic

Indian music appears in help as a humorous wink playing a medley of Beatles songs by Punjabi musicians, George took this seriously
Modal music is music whose form is not determinded by harmonic movement, often only using one fundamental chord throughout

Paul had been living in London in an apartment rather than on suburban estates and had become interested in the modern art scene
a friend opened a bookstore concentrating on experimental art and Paul would spend nights there, sending books to his bandmates he liked

Europe
serialism - mechanizing selection of musical elements
electronics - using studio techniques as principle sound sources rather than traditional musical instruments
musique concrete - the separation of sound/music from identifiable sources to become architectural

America
free improvisation - performing without reference to any pre existing structural elements with complete freedom of choice
indeterminacy - performing while using non musical structural elements so that while the output is unplanned, the process is exact

notice that both have non tonality (don't deal with traditional harmony or sound "nice")

LSD
George and John were introduced by a London dentist in 1965
they tried it at a party in LA later in the year
George got too high and began to panic, feeling that he was dying
trying to be helpful, very high Peter Fonda told George about how he shot himself on accident as a child and his heart stopped beating
