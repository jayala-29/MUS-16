recap
the White Album was a massive success but the conflicts that arose during the recording seemed to point towards the end
Apple Corps was turning into a financial disaster so The Beatles are trying to prevent a collapse
Paul's attempts to keep the band together turned into hours of unused material
Klein took over as The Beatles' manager and tried to get things back into shape
knowing that the end was near, The Beatles are back in the studio with Martin and Emmerick

NEMS still had proprietary right to a part of The Beatles' income, inherited by Brian's brother, but were sold to an investment bank
The Beatles and Klein were not happy with this, the bank refused to negotiate with Klein because of his lies and bluffs
Klein contacted EMI and ordered them to send all accrued and future monies to Apple's own merchant bank for redistribution
or else he would ensure that Paul made good on his "God Save the Queen" threat from two years prior
with no obvious answer, everything went to court
Paul and John tried to convince London bankers to sign over control of their shares, allowing them to apply for NT designation
after reading this, the bankers withdrew from the deal

The Beatles and Klein pooled their own group of investors and then offered to buy ATV shares from them
negotiations and threats of legal action went on throughout the summer of 1969 until John and Paul sold their portion

Paul attempted to buy back the catalogue in 1981 for 20000000 euros but was told to Michael Jackson in 1984 for 24000000 euros
Penny Lane was excluded and was given to the daughter of ATV's director

Klein was able to negotiate a new distribution deal with EMI that was favorable to The Beatles
scheduling for the studio was difficult and in order to keep income rolling, a quick mix was done for 2 songs off of Get Back
released April 1969, was their 17th #1 hit in the U.S., the only official Beatles release with a co-credit

after derailments and distractions, recording started for a new album at EMI Studios
The Beatles were there until August and things predictably devolved
despite tensions, the group was able to stay focused
The Beatles noticed the Moog Modular Synthesizer sitting in the closet
Paul was curious and so they started to try to figure out how to use it
Abbey Road is now widely viewed as the first pop record to use a synthesizer

Abbey Road was released on September 26, 1969
