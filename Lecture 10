recap
the White Album was a massive success but the conflicts that arose during the recording seemed to point towards the end
Apple Corps was turning into a financial disaster so The Beatles are trying to prevent a collapse
Paul's attempts to keep the band together turned into hours of unused material
Klein took over as The Beatles' manager and tried to get things back into shape
knowing that the end was near, The Beatles are back in the studio with Martin and Emmerick

NEMS still had proprietary right to a part of The Beatles' income, inherited by Brian's brother, but were sold to an investment bank
The Beatles and Klein were not happy with this, the bank refused to negotiate with Klein because of his lies and bluffs
Klein contacted EMI and ordered them to send all accrued and future monies to Apple's own merchant bank for redistribution
or else he would ensure that Paul made good on his "God Save the Queen" threat from two years prior
with no obvious answer, everything went to court
Paul and John tried to convince London bankers to sign over control of their shares, allowing them to apply for NT designation
after reading this, the bankers withdrew from the deal

The Beatles and Klein pooled their own group of investors and then offered to buy ATV shares from them
negotiations and threats of legal action went on throughout the summer of 1969 until John and Paul sold their portion

Paul attempted to buy back the catalogue in 1981 for 20000000 euros but was told to Michael Jackson in 1984 for 24000000 euros
Penny Lane was excluded and was given to the daughter of ATV's director

Klein was able to negotiate a new distribution deal with EMI that was favorable to The Beatles
scheduling for the studio was difficult and in order to keep income rolling, a quick mix was done for 2 songs off of Get Back
released April 1969, was their 17th #1 hit in the U.S., the only official Beatles release with a co-credit

after derailments and distractions, recording started for a new album at EMI Studios
The Beatles were there until August and things predictably devolved
despite tensions, the group was able to stay focused
The Beatles noticed the Moog Modular Synthesizer sitting in the closet
Paul was curious and so they started to try to figure out how to use it
Abbey Road is now widely viewed as the first pop record to use a synthesizer

Abbey Road was released on September 26, 1969
(Come Together)
written by John with lyrical contributions from George
inspired by LSD advocate Timothy Learly's 1969 gubernatorial campaign slogan
similar to Chuck Berry's "Can't Catch Me"
John is saying "Shoot Me" during the intro but the "me" is obscured by the bass
(Something)
written by George, John's favorite song on the album
Billy Preston was invited to play the organ
(Maxwell's Silver Hammer)
began recording the day John returned from his car accident recovery but would not play on Paul's granny songs
the difficulties of the weight of the hammer that was used on the anvil and problems with the Moog led to large amount of time
(Oh Darling)
Paul's tribute to the 1950s
originally recorded during the Get Back sessions, basic tracks were recorded at the beginning of the Abbey Road sessions
Paul spent a month arriving alone at the studio at 2:00 and doing one take of the vocals until he was happy with it
(Octopus's Garden)
written by Ringo during the period that he had quit and was hiding out in Sardinia
he was served octopus at a local fish shop and struck up a conversation with the owner about it
only the 2nd song that Ringo wrote
lyrics may have been changed to be about George and Ringo in the studio
(I Want You (She's So Heavy))
that's me about Yoko - John
attempted during the Get Back sessions and possibly again in February 1969
tapes may or may not have been mislabeled so the source of the basic tracks is unclear
John had the idea to add white noise to the recording using the Moog and abruptly ordered to stop the tape
Paul was unhappy that the music was being obliterated by the noise
(Here Comes the Sun)
written by George when going out to a friend's house in the country
picked up the guitar for the first time in a couple weeks and the first thing that came out - George
showed that George could write just as well as John or Paul
(Because)
written by John, inspired by Yoko's book "Grapefruit"
features 3-part harmony, the first time in years that Paul, John, and George had sung together
uses the Moog
THE ABBEY ROAD MEDLEY
decided to use the bulk of side two to record various odds-and-ends that they had written to be strung together
left blank spots for counting just like A Day in the Life
felt like a band again
(You Never Give Me Your Money)
constructed from 5 or 6 of Paul's song fragments
lambasting Allan Klein's attitude towards us: no money, just funny paper, all promises and it never works out - Paul
(Sun King)
written by John after reading a biography of Louis XIV
we just strung someSpanish words together that sounded vaguely like anything - John
they disappeared behind the screens at one point for a puff on a joint... it was impossible to get through a whole take - Geoff
