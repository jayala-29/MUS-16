Recap
The White Album was an unpleasant experience
Geoff Emmerick quits
George Martin was becoming a crisis manager and musical structure was falling apart
nonetheless, the album sold 3.3 million copies in the U.S. in 4 days

the store was closed and the remaining contents were given away for free
left was Apple Records, Apple Films, and the Magic Alex-run Apple Electronics

the offices of Apple Corps were rapidly descending into madness by July 1968
when showing up to "work" again, their demeanor had changed from "fun" to mistrust

Apple Records was intended to serve for both Beatles releases and each individual's projects and discoveries

first album release: George wrote soundtrack for a movie (Wonderwall) and rewrote them for a solo instrumental album
third album release: John's first ever recording without The Beatles, consists almost entirely of tape loops, problematic cover

Stephen Maltz resigns (head accountant of Apple Corps) in late October 1968
all investments through various Apple decisions, none had seen any return and had to be underwritten by album sales
John and Yoko are arrested on drug charges in October 1968

Paul had begun an affair with Linda Eastman, who recommended her dad, who was a lawyer, to fix the money problem
Eastman advocated for consolidation of intellectual properties and rights, an unsafe investment which would cost a lot of money
The Beatles agreed with Eastman, took him on a general counsel and began to buy up all of their copyrights

Paul suggested that the best way to escape their problems was to get back on the road as a small band
nobody other than Paul was interested but convinced them to agree to a one-off television special and a new record
Paul hired Michael Lindsay-Hogg to film a "making-of" documentary to accompany the eventual TV show in January 1969
George quits on January 10th
a week after quitting, George met up with The Beatles and agreed to return for a last album but not the TV special
the band had no intention to return to Abbey Road for recording another record
so they were going to record in the studio Magic Alex was building, 72 tracks and had a force field

on January 20, 1969 George Martin arrived to prepare the studio to begin recording on January 27th
George Harrison called it the biggest disaster of all time
Magic Alex was dismissive of their complaints but it was clear that the studio was unusable

they wanted this new album to sound live and have a spirit of spontaneity
John started to rail against the media that George Martin was the brains behind The Beatles
George Martin eventually stopped showing up
they gave themselves a week to make the album, starting on January 22nd

the band jammed old songs and John and Paul started to write songs together again
day three is when tensions began to mount again, Yoko and John's heroin addiction are blamed for much of the tension
George bumped into Billy Preston, old time friend, and invited him to break the tension
