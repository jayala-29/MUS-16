no longer interested in participating in Beatlemania and no longer interested in maintaining any kind of public image

John went to Spain, acted in a film “How I Won the War”, and was on the beach with his guitar
George went to India in search of both musical and spiritual enlightenment
Ringo joined John in Spain because “he said he was lonely”
Paul donned a disguise and traipsed first around the Loire Valley in France, and then in Kenya

while on his meandering journey, Paul began to toy with the idea of inventing a fake band, The Beatles but not “The Beatles”
on the flight back from Kenya, Paul and friend Mal Evans were riffing on the idea until they noticed the salt and pepper packets
they had developed the entire concept for “Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”

as the Beatles are transitioning away from their early period’s artistic model, it is proving to be a difficult time for Epstein
Epstein “accidentally” mixed alcohol and sleeping pills in Sept. 1966 but was discovered by a friend and rushed to the hospital1

Press had begun to report rumours that The Beatles had broken up, that they were secretly seeking new management

Strawberry Fields Forever
George Martin had wanted to try out a new instrument: the Mellotron
it took them 45 hours of tape over the course of a whole month to record the song
they matched two sections of the song by altering tape speeds so that they appeared to be in the same key and tempo

Penny Lane
John inspired Paul to write a response to both about the bus stop where he exited to visit John’s house when they were teenagers
began on December 29 with Paul layering multiple piano tracks at a slower-than normal tape speed to give it a dreamy quality
Paul sang the solo to Martin who transcribed it and Mason sight read it in one take
took 3 weeks to record and the final mix was rushed to be released as a single in late January

single only reached number 2 and although a disappointment to financial interests, The Beatles viewed it as a liberating factor
music videos were recorded for both songs and are widely regarded as the first modern music videos

Epstein’s but continued to become distracted easily, became exasperated by refusal to leave the studio for interviews/press appearances
when Epstein negotiated an extension to their EMI contract he neglected to tell the Beatles

Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
first rock concept album, we’re listening to a recording of a band that isn’t The Beatles but that is being played by The Beatles
(Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/With a Little Help from my Friends)
introduction of the theme of the album – that we’re not actually listening to The Beatles, but someone else
(Lovely Rita)
one of Paul's granny songs
(Good Morning, Good Morning)
inspired by John’s boredom in the suburbs, breakfast cereal ads on the television
John called the song “a piece of garbage”
John wanted the sounds of animals to be those of successively more aggressive and larger ones
(A Day in the Life)
John wrote the lyrics, mostly directly taken from two articles in the newspaper
the crescendo in the middle was left empty with Mal Evans responsible for counting the number of beats in the middle
the final chord is 6 pianos at once, with Geoff Emmerick raising the recording volume as the instruments decay

the album was a massive success, outselling every previous Beatles album
during initial weeks of release, American radio stations cancelled regular programming and put the entire album into rotation

Brian Epstein was unsuccessfully trying to convince the band to make a new movie to fulfil their contract with United Artists
as a homage to the popular “Mystery” bus tours of Paul’s youth, they would make a movie called the “Magical Mystery Tour”
