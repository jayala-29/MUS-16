no longer interested in participating in Beatlemania and no longer interested in maintaining any kind of public image

John went to Spain, acted in a film “How I Won the War”, and was on the beach with his guitar
George went to India in search of both musical and spiritual enlightenment
Ringo joined John in Spain because “he said he was lonely”
Paul donned a disguise and traipsed first around the Loire Valley in France, and then in Kenya

while on his meandering journey, Paul began to toy with the idea of inventing a fake band, The Beatles but not “The Beatles”
on the flight back from Kenya, Paul and friend Mal Evans were riffing on the idea until they noticed the salt and pepper packets
they had developed the entire concept for “Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band”

as the Beatles are transitioning away from their early period’s artistic model, it is proving to be a difficult time for Epstein
Epstein “accidentally” mixed alcohol and sleeping pills in Sept. 1966 but was discovered by a friend and rushed to the hospital1

Press had begun to report rumours that The Beatles had broken up, that they were secretly seeking new management

Strawberry Fields Forever
George Martin had wanted to try out a new instrument: the Mellotron
it took them 45 hours of tape over the course of a whole month to record the song
they matched two sections of the song by altering tape speeds so that they appeared to be in the same key and tempo

Penny Lane
John inspired Paul to write a response to both about the bus stop where he exited to visit John’s house when they were teenagers
began on December 29 with Paul layering multiple piano tracks at a slower-than normal tape speed to give it a dreamy quality
Paul sang the solo to Martin who transcribed it and Mason sight read it in one take
took 3 weeks to record and the final mix was rushed to be released as a single in late January

single only reached number 2 in Britain and although a disappointment to financial interests, The Beatles viewed it as a liberating factor
music videos were recorded for both songs and are widely regarded as the first modern music videos

Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club
first rock concept album, we’re listening to a recording of a band that isn’t The Beatles but that is being played by The Beatles

Epstein’s but continued to become distracted easily, became exasperated by refusal to leave the studio for interviews/press appearances
