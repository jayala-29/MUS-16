Apple corps - multimedia corporation founded in London in January 1968 by The Beatles to replace their earlier company

during Spring 1967, The Beatles were told by NEMS accountants they would lose income to taxes unless they formed their own corporation
Epstein died before the “Apple” idea could be fully formed
after Epstein’s death, the Beatles learned that Robert Stigwood had become a partner in NEMS and had a potentially controlling interest
Paul offered to remain with NEMS in return for a controlling stake
Stigwood refused, and NEMS properties were split between he and Clive Epstein
The Beatles were now completely free to run their own affairs via their new company, Apple Music

Yanni Alexis Mardas, aka Magic Alex, first met John at Indica Gallery and Books in 1965, where John bought his “Nothing Box”
The Beatles all became friends with him and began to fund his inventions: force field, invisibility paint, 72-track recording machine
The Beatles also formed a subsidiary company, Apple Electronics, headed by Magic Alex making him the first employee of Apple Corps
Apple Electronics’ first project a portable sun that would light up all of London for the opening of The Apple Boutique
the band softened on the retail idea since they now had something to sell for The Apple Boutique
alongside Magic Alex’s inventions the band commissioned Dutch arts collective, The Fool, to create a clothing line

Mahareshi Mahesh Yogi was the founder of the modern transcendental school of meditation
the guru engaged in “World Tours” that served to promote his technique as a means of spiritual healing rather than a religious movement

Lady Madonna
written solely by Paul, a jam on a 50’s boogie woogie piano riff with Paul doing an imitation of Fats Domino

Hey Bulldog
written by John, “a throwaway song that means nothing”
was concieved, learned, recorded and mixed in less than 10 hours after Paul started to bark in the studio

on February 15th, 1969, The Beatles left for India
John and George were finally in their element, they threw themselves into the Maharishi’s teachings, and were happy
Paul said that he had trouble keeping his mind clear 
while in India George appeared to have lost interest in Indian music and began to intensely practice guitar
Ringo left after only 10 days because he missed his children and he hated the food
Paul after a month to begin planning the new record
John was secretly communicating with Yoko Ono on a daily basis
Magic Alex was appalled when he arrived and immediately identified the Maharishi as a charlatan
George, John, Magic Alex, and the rest of their entourage abruptly left for London on April 11, 1968

by the time I came back they’d opened the office there were rooms full of lunatics - George
Ringo was unwilling to make any decisions
Paul oversaw everything from building the offices to designing the layouts
an increasingly depressed and drug-addled John left his wife, Cynthia for Yoko Ono

on May 30, The Beatles entered Abbey Road studios to record their next album
Ono “just moved in” and John seemed to be daring the others to say something
John had become a full-blown heroin addict and allowed Ono to make his decisions for him
Paul and John had become openly hostile with one another, frightening lowlevel studio employees with their violent outbursts
three studios were kept running at all times – one each for John/Yoko, Paul and George – with only Ringo moving between them

The White Album
