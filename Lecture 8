Apple corps - multimedia corporation founded in London in January 1968 by The Beatles to replace their earlier company

during Spring 1967, The Beatles were told by NEMS accountants they would lose income to taxes unless they formed their own corporation
Epstein died before the “Apple” idea could be fully formed
after Epstein’s death, the Beatles learned that Robert Stigwood had become a partner in NEMS and had a potentially controlling interest
Paul offered to remain with NEMS in return for a controlling stake
Stigwood refused, and NEMS properties were split between he and Clive Epstein
The Beatles were now completely free to run their own affairs via their new company, Apple Music

Yanni Alexis Mardas, aka Magic Alex, first met John at Indica Gallery and Books in 1965, where John bought his “Nothing Box”
The Beatles all became friends with him and began to fund his inventions: force field, invisibility paint, 72-track recording machine
The Beatles also formed a subsidiary company, Apple Electronics, headed by Magic Alex making him the first employee of Apple Corps
