Apple corps - multimedia corporation founded in London in January 1968 by The Beatles to replace their earlier company

during Spring 1967, The Beatles were told by NEMS accountants they would lose income to taxes unless they formed their own corporation
Epstein died before the “Apple” idea could be fully formed
after Epstein’s death, the Beatles learned that Robert Stigwood had become a partner in NEMS and had a potentially controlling interest
Paul offered to remain with NEMS in return for a controlling stake
Stigwood refused, and NEMS properties were split between he and Clive Epstein
The Beatles were now completely free to run their own affairs via their new company, Apple Music

Yanni Alexis Mardas, aka Magic Alex, first met John at Indica Gallery and Books in 1965, where John bought his “Nothing Box”
The Beatles all became friends with him and began to fund his inventions: force field, invisibility paint, 72-track recording machine
The Beatles also formed a subsidiary company, Apple Electronics, headed by Magic Alex making him the first employee of Apple Corps
Apple Electronics’ first project a portable sun that would light up all of London for the opening of The Apple Boutique
the band softened on the retail idea since they now had something to sell for The Apple Boutique
alongside Magic Alex’s inventions the band commissioned Dutch arts collective, The Fool, to create a clothing line

Mahareshi Mahesh Yogi was the founder of the modern transcendental school of meditation
the guru engaged in “World Tours” that served to promote his technique as a means of spiritual healing rather than a religious movement

Lady Madonna
written solely by Paul, a jam on a 50’s boogie woogie piano riff with Paul doing an imitation of Fats Domino

Hey Bulldog
written by John, “a throwaway song that means nothing”
was concieved, learned, recorded and mixed in less than 10 hours after Paul started to bark in the studio

on February 15th, 1969, The Beatles left for India
John and George were finally in their element, they threw themselves into the Maharishi’s teachings, and were happy
Paul said that he had trouble keeping his mind clear 
while in India George appeared to have lost interest in Indian music and began to intensely practice guitar
Ringo left after only 10 days because he missed his children and he hated the food
Paul after a month to begin planning the new record
John was secretly communicating with Yoko Ono on a daily basis
Magic Alex was appalled when he arrived and immediately identified the Maharishi as a charlatan
George, John, Magic Alex, and the rest of their entourage abruptly left for London on April 11, 1968

by the time I came back they’d opened the office there were rooms full of lunatics - George
Ringo was unwilling to make any decisions
Paul oversaw everything from building the offices to designing the layouts
an increasingly depressed and drug-addled John left his wife, Cynthia for Yoko Ono

on May 30, The Beatles entered Abbey Road studios to record their next album
Ono “just moved in” and John seemed to be daring the others to say something
John had become a full-blown heroin addict and allowed Ono to make his decisions for him
Paul and John had become openly hostile with one another, frightening lowlevel studio employees with their violent outbursts
three studios were kept running at all times – one each for John/Yoko, Paul and George – with only Ringo moving between them

The White Album
they were unable to agree on paring down the number of songs to be included so they released a double album
(Back in the USSR)
written by Paul, after joking with Mike Love at the ashram about dedicating a song to Russian girls 
as a wink to Love, included prominent Beach Boys style vocals
this is the period when Ringo quit so Paul played the drums
(Dear Prudence)
written by John about Mia Farrow’s sister, Prudence who was at the ashram with them
Prudence locked herself in a cabin had refused to leave until John wrote the song and he and George played it through the locked door
song had fingerpick style guitar playing, also recorded without Ringo
(Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da)
took a month to record, and John hated the nonsense lyrics 
after multiple attempts the group couldn’t get the rocksteady rhythm to their liking so John banged the piano and left with Yoko
Paul was having difficulty singing it to George Martin’s liking
(The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill)
written about a guy in Maharishi’s meditation camp who took a break to shoot a few tigers and came back to commune with God
recording communally in 3 takes - everyone present participated somehow
Yoko sings the first female and non-Beatle lead on a Beatles recording
(While My Guitar Gently Weeps)
John and Paul were still overlooking George’s contributions
Paul and John’s performances on the recorded takes were half-assed and absent
we did just one take and it sounded fantastic - Eric Clapton
(Blackbird)
regarded as one of Paul’s greatest songs, next to Yesterday
only Paul, singing, playing guitar, and tapping his feet
Paul later claimed that it was about Angela Davis and the civil rights movement
(Mother Nature’s Son)
about the Maharishi, Paul’s opinion of him hadn’t been tainted by Magic Alex like George and John
after 102 takes of a George Harrison song that was never released, Paul recorded the song alone
brass were added later as overdubs alongside percussion and a track of Paul hitting a book of poems by Longfellow
(Sexy Sadie)
originally “Maharishi”, George convinced John to change it to “Sexy Sadie” but he left the rest of the lyrics intact
(Savoy Truffle)
George’s Ode to Chocolate
(Revolution 9)
consisted of recorded tapes, some played backwords, and random noises
(Helter Skelter)
Charles Manson was freed to San Francisco where he formed a hippie cult while trying to succeed in the music business
began to teach his followers that we was effectively Jesus and predicting a coming race war
Manson came to believe that the Beatles were trying to communicate with him via the White Album
the race war, called Helter Skelter, could be hastened by attacking white upper classes, the Piggies, and blaming the attacks on blacks
