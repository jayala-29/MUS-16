emergence of new genre in Europe -- dixieland -> skiffle, UK attempt of capturing of American sound FAILS

AMERICA
Mowtown sound post 1950s
pop charts are full of singles and albums are mostly LPs
folk music becomes popular in the early 1960s (alongside Jazz for teens and college students)
in 1963 music becomes so diverse that there's no distinguish between 'black' and 'white' music
1963 -> Martha and the Vandellas, The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and James Brown are main outlet of music
#1 song post-JFK assassination is The Singing Nun by Dominique
She Loves You becomes #1 song overnight -- Beatles are popular even before they perform for the 1st time
02/11/1964 Beatles play 18000 people show with a PA system and go crazy like in Hamburg 
Hard Day's Night becomes a huge success (both the album and the movie)

UK
Royal Variety Show sparks interests for all ages (not just screaming teens anymore)
Beatles were not popular in the US pre-1963
Beatles start to have Motown sound (influenced from US music) and record for European audience (Smokey Robinson)
Brian Epstein's main goal was to gain popularity for the Beatles in the US
